# Python_homeworks

Here u can check my homeworks for classes of Pyrhon in my university

First was about Fibonacci numbers and elderly array sort

In second u can see task of counting unique symblos in string and some tricks with reading smth from text file

Third is the most hard to understand:
first task counted fibonacci numbers with magic help of itheratots
second checked string-palindrom
third used decorators with free-signature functions
fourth just killed the matrix (._.))))
